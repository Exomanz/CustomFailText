# CustomFailText
An update for Arti's original CustomFailText for Beat Saber 1.11!

This plugin changes the default "LEVEL FAILED" text in Beat Saber to something more customizable.

All credits for this plugin will go to [Arti](https://gitlab.com/artemiswkearney "The Original Modder"), as I just updated it for the most recent version.

## Features
* Picks a random entry from the config file at `/UserData/CustomFailText.txt`.
* Offers TextMeshPro styling, including colors, size, and much more. See the [TextMeshPro Documentation](http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/rich-text/ "TextMeshPro Docs") for more information.
* Works in all game modes **(including online)**!

## Roadpath
* Add support for multiple configs via in-game UI, as well as enabling and disabling the mod.
* Clean up the code.
* Suggestions are welcome!

## Dependencies
* BSIPA v4.0.9
* BS_Utils v1.6.5
* BSML v1.4.2 **(eventually)**

## Installation

Grab the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/Exomanz/CustomFailText/releases/ "Mod Releases Page") page and install it in your Plugins folder at your Beat Saber directory.
